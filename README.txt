== Description ==

Plugin for WordPress websites that require a user to sign in (e.g. with Microsoft using the [WPO365](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpo365-login/) plugin) and that are loaded inside an iframe (e.g. inside a Microsoft Teams App / Tab or similar). The plugin overrides the pluggable WordPress function **wp_set_auth_cookie** to *always* set **SameSite=None** to enable third-party usage of cookies.

= Prerequisites =

- The **SameSite=None** flag is only respected by browsers such as Chrome when the cookie's Secure flag is set. Therefore the website must use SSL for the plugin to effectively enable browser support for 3rd party cookies.

I haven't been able to test our plugin in all endless possible Wordpress configurations and versions so I am keen to hear from you and happy to learn!

= v1.4 =
* Fix: Tested with latest versions of WordPress and PHP.

= v1.3 =
* Fix: Tested with latest versions of WordPress and PHP.

= v1.2 =
* Fix: Added support for PHP 8.

= v1.1 =
* Fix: The plugin would end up in an infinitely loop when using PHP 7.2 or older. This has been fixed by implementing a work-around that abuses the "path" or "domain" parameter of PHP's "setcookie" function to sneak in the SameSite attribute because PHP does not escape semicolons.

= v1.0 =
* Initial version
